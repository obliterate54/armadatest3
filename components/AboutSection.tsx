                üîß About Armada

                <p>
                  Armada started with a simple truth:<br />
                  <strong>Driving is better when you're not doing it alone.</strong> And Networking is pretty hard when you don't know where to look
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  We're car people, Text threads didn't cut it. Location sharing was messy. And always needing to scavenge social media gets annoying, So we built what we wished existed‚Äîa real-time app that brings drivers together the way car culture was meant to be felt: live, moving, and united.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  <strong>Armada isn't just a tool.</strong> It's a platform built for the community, from solo riders to full-blown car clubs. Every tap, feature, and animation was designed with purpose: to make driving feel shared again.
